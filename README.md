####A Custom Web Server (In C# Without IIS)

##General Info
* A simple web server built on http.sys.  
* A great introductory tutorial on this method is available [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163879.aspx)
* Basically, i wanted a web server to use as backend on a desktop app but decided to first, build a simple web server code base


##How to Use
Using this is pretty simple, basically execute the .exe in the bin and your up and running.  You can customize the codebase to suit your needs pretty easily, just modify the `Server.Start()` method.
